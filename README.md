# QTC_2.0-homework

My homework for QTC has been saved in this repository.

I use PyCharm to edit first day's homework, so I commit some **.py files**, if you want to run these code, please use IDE for Python such as PyCharm.

In the second day, I used Jupyter Notebook to do my homework, if you want to view these code, please use Jupyter Notebook to open them.
